# Buffalo-Crime-Incidents-ML-modelling
This project is based on analysis of the Buffalo city's Crime Data for the past one year using machine-learning-based crime prediction. It reviews the attributes in the data that are most responsible for different types of incidents at different Council Districts in Buffalo by using Exploratory Data Analysis and predict the future by implementing different Machine Learning models especially Classifiers( Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Random Forest) implemented and evaluate accuracy given by each algorithm.
